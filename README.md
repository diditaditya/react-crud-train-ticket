## Train Ticket Reservation (React-CRUD)

This simple project demonstrates how to implement CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), routed with [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and beautified with [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) components.


Keep in mind that since the data is saved only in the Redux store, it is of course not persistent.
